===============

Useful dot-files are stored here. Top-levels dirs are for a particular program
or use, with the root-level file view placed within each.

Licensing

Unless otherwise noted in a particular file's header, my code, config, and any
modifications I have made to standard configs is available under a BSD 3-clause
license.

Some files may contain parts of standard-generated configs as well.
